# hello-world
The quintessential training wheels repository.

Every journey into a new coding environment requires baby-steps to understand 
the rules and processes to accommodate group work.  Git-hub is no different.

This hello-world repository contains a simple playground where a person can
learn how to use the git-hub respository, branch, and commit processes to make 
coding organized, collaborative, and (hopefully) correct.

Hello World!


Let's make some changes.
